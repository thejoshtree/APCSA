/*
This class is a practice of a card game. To design the game, we can go through the logics.
This is an open game, could be various.
step 1. what is the class name?
step 2. create instance variable: suite, rank, pointValue.  Create private variables.
brainstorming the process to figure out what variables include in the card.
step 2. Construct the class: what attributes/states could we have in a card game?
Card(String theRank, String theSuit, int pv)
step 3. accessor methods. getCard(), calValue(), matches(Card c), toString(), getSuit(), getRank(), getPointValue()
 */

                        // this refers to the object itself in the class. the same as 'self' in python.
