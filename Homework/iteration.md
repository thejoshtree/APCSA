1. Write a program where the user enters an integer, and the program keeps doubling that number
 until it is greater than 99 or less than-99. The program displays the numbers and afterwards how many
 times the number was doubled. Assume they do NOT enter a zero.

e.g. 

Enter an integer.

-3-6-12-24-48-96-192

 The number was doubled 6 times.

 
2.  Write a program that generates and displays 5 random integers and then displays their average
 as a double. The random integers should be in the range [1, 10]. You must use a while loop to generate
 the five integers.

e.g.

 9 3 3 8 1
 
 The average is 4.8
 
3. Write a program that does the following.
 First, player one is asked to enter an integer in the range [1, 50]. The program gets the number and then
 prints 50 blank lines (which hides the secret number from player two).
 Then player two must guess the secret number. If their guess is too high, the program prints Too High. If
 too low, the program prints Too Low. In either case, player 2 is then asked to guess again. The program
 keeps going until player 2 correctly guesses the number. When player 2 guesses correctly, the program
 displays Correct! and the number of guesses.

e.g. 

What is the secret number?

 45
 
 fifty blank lines
 
 Guess the secret number: 56
 
 Too high. Guess again. 33
 
 Too low. Guess again. 40
 
 Too low. Guess again. 45

 Correct!
 
 Number of guesses: 4
