Write a program to meet the requirements:
1. User input an element
2. The program will output the electron configuration with subshell.

e.g. Fe
1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^6

note: if your output could have the superscript of the numbers, it would be great. otherwise use ^ to represent the superscript.

How to design your program?
1.  Write down the psudo code. 
- If you could draw a flow chart, use the chart.
- use natural language to define the process.

2. Define all variables needed in the flow chart.
3. Write your program and test them.

Where to submit? Take a screenshot of your program and send me a doc file.
